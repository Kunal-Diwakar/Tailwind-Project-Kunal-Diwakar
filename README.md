# ToDekstop-Project
In this project, I have built a website that showcases the power of Tailwind CSS. I have created a responsive layout, and style elements, and explored some commonly used utility classes in making this website.

# Technologies Used
HTML: For creating the webpage structure.</br>
Tailwind CSS: To apply utility classes for styling.</br>
JavaScript: For interactive elements in the website.
